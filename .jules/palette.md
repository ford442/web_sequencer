## 2024-05-01 - Fix aria-controls for Harmonizer Popover
**Learning:** Found that custom dropdowns/popovers acting as modals or flyouts require a clear structural link using `aria-controls` pointing to the exact `id` of the popover content. The `aria-expanded` and `aria-haspopup` tags alone are insufficient for complete screen reader accessibility if the container it targets cannot be identified via an `id` reference.
**Action:** Always ensure that `aria-controls` matches a specific `id` attribute on the container component whenever implementing custom popup interfaces.
## 2024-06-25 - Advanced Keyboard Interaction Patterns
**Learning:** For a complex app like a DAW, simple gestural controls (like dragging up/down to change pitch) are entirely inaccessible to keyboard-only users. Furthermore, when closing deep nested menus like popovers, relying on the browser's default focus management will drop the user back at the top of the page, ruining the navigation flow.
**Action:** Always provide explicit arrow-key support (`onKeyDown`) for gestural or slider-like UI elements to replicate drag behavior. Always use a `useRef` to track the trigger element that opened a popover, and explicitly call `.focus()` on it when the popover closes.

## 2024-05-09 - Accessibility in Canvas Overlays
**Learning:** Interactive elements within dense, absolute-positioned canvas overlays (like `HarmonizerPopover`) frequently lack focus rings because they aren't part of standard top-to-bottom form flows. Developers often style them as custom widgets but forget keyboard-only navigation needs visible focus states just as much as standard HTML forms do.
**Action:** Always check custom popovers, context menus, and floating widgets for `focus-visible:ring-2` to ensure keyboard accessibility.
